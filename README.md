This GitHub Action provides a way of parsing dotnet test results from trx files in a given directory. The action will find trx files specified in the `TRX-PATH` input variable. This path must be accessible to the action.

It will read each individual .trx file. Loads up its data and converts it to a typed json object to make it easier to traverse through the data.
For each TRX, it will create a Github Status check and generate a markup report for each trx. The report name and title are derived from the trx file using the `data.TestRun.TestDefinitions.UnitTest[0]._storage`

## Usage

To make `trx-parser` a part of your workflow, just add the following to your existing workflow file in your `.github/workflows/` directory in your GitHub repository.

```yml
name: Test
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  Build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Replace this whichever way you build your code
      - name: Build & Test dotnet code
        run: |
          dotnet restore
          dotnet build -c Release no-restore
          dotnet test -c Release --no-restore --no-build --loger trx --results-directory ./TestResults
